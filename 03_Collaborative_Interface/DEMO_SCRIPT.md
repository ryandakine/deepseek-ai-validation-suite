    async def scan_opportunities():
        for pair in ['BTC/USDT', 'ETH/USDT']:
            buy_price = await get_lowest_price(exchanges, pair)
            sell_price = await get_highest_price(exchanges, pair)
            
            profit_margin = (sell_price - buy_price) / buy_price
            if profit_margin > target_profit:
                return execute_arbitrage(pair, buy_price, sell_price)
