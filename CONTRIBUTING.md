## 📝 Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Documentation
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Document API endpoints and parameters
- Include usage examples for new functionality

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `test:` for adding tests
- `refactor:` for code refactoring

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow secure coding practices
- Report security vulnerabilities privately
