LINKEDIN POST:
Just shipped something incredible for the #ResendMCPHackathon! 

🎯 Problem: AI tools refuse to validate "controversial" code (crypto, betting, security testing) due to moral filtering

💡 Solution: Multi-agent consensus validation + Resend MCP for automated email delivery

The result? Professional validation reports for ANY code, delivered deterministically via email. Perfect for dev teams who need content-neutral analysis.

This is exactly what MCP enables - reliable tool calling that opens up entirely new workflows.

Check out the demo: github.com/ryandakine/deepseek-ai-validation-suite
