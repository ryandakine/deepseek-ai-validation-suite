## 🎯 **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Traditional code validation tools are limited:
- ❌ **Single-perspective analysis** misses complex issues
- ❌ **No deterministic reporting** for validation results
- ❌ **Poor visual presentation** of findings
- ❌ **Manual email distribution** of reports
- ❌ **No specialized validation** for controversial/complex code types

**The gap:** Developers need **multi-agent consensus validation** with **professional email reporting** via **deterministic MCP integration**.
